# lcc_gondola_comments

Comments in the EIS report
(<https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/>) were scraped
from the PDFs and parsed into a table “comments table.csv”. Comment
codes (see
<https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LCC_FEIS_32_Response_to_Comments.pdf>
for definitions) are consolidated in “comment codes.csv”.

Note that the parsing has not being rigorously error checked. Please use
the issue tracker here to document any problems. Forking and PRs are
welcome, as are the addition of analysis scripts.
